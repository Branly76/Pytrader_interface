The Pytrader ecosystem consists of a python script and a MT5 or MT4 EA. Further for the licensing an indicator is used. Documentation for connecting Metatrader 5 and metatrader 4 with Python using a simple drag and drop EA. A full suited solution and fully tested , fast and efficient.

The communication between the python script and the EA is based on websockets. EA is the Server and the python script the Client. It is always query(function / python script) and output(data / server). The EA does not need to run on same computer as the python script is running on. On our Github link you will find the python script, the EAâ€™s, full documentation, and a Pytrader example script showing how to call the functions. For questions we have also a discord channel. In demo (without licensing indicator) also full functionality, but for a limited number of instruments (EURUSD, AUDCHF, NZDCHF, GBPNZD and USDCAD).
